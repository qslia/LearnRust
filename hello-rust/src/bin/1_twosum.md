No worries — I’ll walk you through the Rust code slowly, even if you’ve never touched Rust before. Think of it step by step 👇

## 🛠 The Problem Recap

We need to find **two numbers in an array that add up to a target**.
We return their **indices**. Only one solution exists.

Example:
`nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9` → Answer: `[0,1]` because `2+7=9`.

---

## 🔎 The Rust Code

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

impl Solution {
    pub fn two_sum(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
        let mut map = HashMap::new(); // value -> index

        for (i, &num) in nums.iter().enumerate() {
            let complement = target - num;
            if let Some(&j) = map.get(&complement) {
                return vec![j as i32, i as i32];
            }
            map.insert(num, i);
        }

        vec![] // fallback (shouldn’t happen, problem guarantees a solution)
    }
}
```

## 🧩 Breaking It Down

### 1. `use std::collections::HashMap;`

Rust doesn’t have hash maps by default. We import them.
Think of `HashMap` as a **dictionary** in Python or a **map** in C++/Java.

---

### 2. `pub fn two_sum(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Vec<i32>`

* `pub fn` = public function.
* `nums: Vec<i32>` = a vector (like a dynamic array) of 32-bit integers.
* `target: i32` = the target sum.
* `-> Vec<i32>` = the function returns a vector of integers (the indices).

So this means:
📦 Input: a list of numbers + a target
📦 Output: a list with **two indices**

---

### 3. `let mut map = HashMap::new();`

* `let` = create a variable.
* `mut` = mutable (we can change it).
* `HashMap::new()` = create an empty map.

We’ll store:
👉 number → index where it appeared.

Example: if nums = `[2,7,11]`, after first step the map will be `{2:0}`.

---

### 4. `for (i, &num) in nums.iter().enumerate() { ... }`

* `.iter()` lets us loop over the vector.
* `.enumerate()` gives both **index** and **value**.
* `(i, &num)` → `i` is index, `num` is the value.

Example:
`nums = [2,7,11]` → loop goes:

* `i=0, num=2`
* `i=1, num=7`
* `i=2, num=11`

---

### 5. `let complement = target - num;`

This is the other number we’re looking for.
If `target=9` and `num=2`, then `complement=7`.

---

### 6. `if let Some(&j) = map.get(&complement) { ... }`

* `map.get(&complement)` → check if `complement` is already in the map.
* If it is, we found the answer.
* `Some(&j)` means the map had the value, and `j` is the index.

So if we already saw `7` at index `1`, and now we are looking at `2`, we can return `[1,0]`.

---

### 7. `map.insert(num, i);`

If we didn’t find the complement, store this number and its index in the map for later.

---

### 8. `return vec![j as i32, i as i32];`

We found the two indices, so return them as a vector.
`as i32` just converts the index (usize) into an i32 type (because the problem expects i32).

---

## ⚡️ Example Walkthrough

Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`

1. Start empty map `{}`.
2. i=0, num=2 → complement=7 → not in map → insert `{2:0}`.
3. i=1, num=7 → complement=2 → found in map (at index 0)!
   → return `[0,1]`.

Done ✅

Would you like me to **translate this into Python code first** (since it’s simpler to read), then show how it maps to Rust step by step? That way you can see the similarity instead of jumping straight into Rust’s stricter syntax.
