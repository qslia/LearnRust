Excellent question — `saturating_sub` is a **safe subtraction method** for integer types in Rust.

Let’s break it down clearly 👇

---

### 🧩 Basic idea:

When you call

```rust
a.saturating_sub(b)
```

it means:

> Subtract `b` from `a`, **but never go below 0** (for unsigned integers).

So:

```rust
5u32.saturating_sub(3) // → 2
3u32.saturating_sub(5) // → 0  (instead of panicking or wrapping around)
```

---

### 🛡 Why we use it here:

In your palindrome code:

```rust
let mut right = chars.len().saturating_sub(1);
```

This prevents a problem if the string is empty.

* Suppose `chars.len() == 0`
* Normally, `0 - 1` would **underflow**, because `usize` can’t represent negative numbers.
  That would cause a panic or wrap around to a huge number.

Using `saturating_sub(1)` ensures it becomes **0 instead of crashing**.

So it’s just a **safe way** to handle the “empty string” case.

---

### 🔍 Example:

```rust
let n = 0usize;
let safe = n.saturating_sub(1); // safe = 0
let risky = n - 1; // ❌ panic in debug mode (underflow)
```

Would you like me to show how this method differs from `wrapping_sub()` and `checked_sub()` (two other subtraction methods in Rust)?
