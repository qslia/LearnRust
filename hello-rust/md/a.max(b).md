You noticed something important — **Rust uses *method syntax*** for operations that many other languages implement as *functions*.

Let's break down **why** Rust does:

```rust
a.max(b)
```

Instead of:

```rust
max(a, b)
```

---

# ✅ 1. Rust is **expression-oriented**

Rust treats numbers as **objects** with methods, similar to:

* C#
* Java
* Swift
* Kotlin

So numeric types have methods like:

```rust
.abs()
.pow()
.sqrt()        // for floats
.clamp()
.max()
.min()
```

This makes chaining extremely natural:

```rust
x.abs().min(10)
```

---

# ✅ 2. Type Inference is Better

Consider:

```rust
max(a, b)
```

For integers, floats, big integers, signed or unsigned:

Which `max` are we calling?

* `i32 :: max(i32, i32)`
* `i64 :: max(i64, i64)`
* `f64 :: max(f64, f64)`
* custom type?

Rust avoids this ambiguity by using methods on the **type** itself.

---

# ✅ 3. Works with custom types

You can define `.max()` for your own types!

Example:

```rust
impl Point {
    fn max(self, other: Self) -> Self {
        ...
    }
}
```

Now you get:

```rust
p1.max(p2)
```

Rust makes it easy to add behaviors to your structs.

---

# ✅ 4. Consistency with Traits

Rust uses traits to add methods to types.

* `max` and `min` come from `Ord`
* `.abs()` comes from signed integer trait

The method style fits the trait system perfectly.

---

# ✅ 5. Method syntax allows chaining

Much nicer than nested max calls:

### Without methods (C-style)

```c
max(max(a, b), c)
```

### With methods

```rust
a.max(b).max(c)
```

Easy to read.

---

# ✅ 6. It's not weird — many modern languages do this

### Kotlin

```kotlin
a.coerceAtLeast(b)
```

### Python (methods everywhere)

```python
string.lower()
list.append()
```

### Swift

```swift
a.distance(to: b)
```

### C++

You can do:

```cpp
a = std::max(a, b);  // free function
```

But also methods in template libraries.

Rust leans into this style.

---

# ✅ 7. Functional vibes

Method calls can be chained like a pipeline:

```rust
number
    .abs()
    .max(10)
    .min(100)
```

Much clearer than:

```rust
min(max(abs(number), 10), 100)
```

---

# ✅ 8. There *is* a `max(a, b)` style alternative!

Rust supports **free functions** too:

```rust
use std::cmp::max;

max(a, b);
```

You can write it that way if you prefer.

But `.max()` is idiomatic.

---

# ✅ Summary

Rust uses `a.max(b)` because:

| Reason                 | Benefit           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| expression-oriented    | chainable         |
| avoids type ambiguity  | simpler inference |
| integrates with traits | extensible        |
| supports custom types  | flexible          |
| cleaner chaining       | readable          |

So it’s not just syntax style — it's tied to Rust’s **design philosophy**.

If you want, I can list 10 useful numeric methods like `.clamp()`, `.signum()`, `.pow()`, etc. to show how powerful method-style syntax becomes!
