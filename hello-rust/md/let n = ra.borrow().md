Absolutely ‚Äî this is a very important Rust pattern when dealing with `Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>`.

We are explaining this block:

```rust
let (va, al, ar) = {
    let n = ra.borrow();
    (n.val, n.left.clone(), n.right.clone())
};
```

---

# ‚úÖ **What this block does**

It extracts three pieces of information from the referenced `TreeNode`:

* `va` ‚Üí current node‚Äôs value (`i32`)
* `al` ‚Üí left child (`Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>`)
* `ar` ‚Üí right child (`Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>`)

Essentially:

> **Look inside the `RefCell`, read the node's value, left, and right pointers.**

---

# ‚úÖ **Why the `{ }` block is needed**

We temporarily borrow the node:

```rust
let n = ra.borrow();
```

This creates a **Ref** borrow, which *must be dropped* before we recurse or push to a queue.
By placing everything inside `{ }`, the borrow ends at the end of the block.

So the borrow doesn‚Äôt leak outside‚Äîvery important with `RefCell`!

---

# ‚úÖ **Why `.clone()`?**

The tree children are:

```rust
Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>
```

`Rc` is reference-counted.
Cloning the `Option<Rc<...>>` means:

* NULL? ‚Üí still null
* Something? ‚Üí increase the reference count but **do not copy the whole subtree**

This is cheap and safe.

---

# ‚úÖ **Step-by-step expansion**

### Step 1: Start block

```rust
{
```

### Step 2: Borrow the node

```rust
let n = ra.borrow();
```

Now `n` acts like `&TreeNode`.

### Step 3: Produce a tuple

```rust
(n.val, n.left.clone(), n.right.clone())
```

This tuple has three fields:

* the value
* the left subtree pointer
* the right subtree pointer

### Step 4: End block

```
}
```

At this point:

* `n` goes **out of scope**
* the borrow ends ‚úÖ

---

# ‚úÖ **Why we can‚Äôt just do this:**

```rust
let n = ra.borrow();
va = n.val;
al = n.left.clone();
ar = n.right.clone();
```

Because `n` stays borrowed until the end of the function, causing:

* **borrow checker errors**
* preventing us from recursively borrowing again

Rust will complain:

```
cannot borrow `ra` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
```

---

# ‚úÖ **Final mental model**

Think of it like:

> ‚ÄúBorrow the node **only long enough** to read its children.
> Then drop the borrow immediately, so recursion is allowed.‚Äù

---

# ‚úÖ **Analogy**

It‚Äôs like opening a book to read three sentences, copying them to your notebook, then closing it ‚Äî so somebody else can use the book.

# ‚úÖ Summary

| Code piece            | Purpose                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `let n = ra.borrow()` | Temporarily open the `RefCell`     |
| `(n.val, ‚Ä¶)`          | Extract required info              |
| `.clone()`            | Increase RC count, don‚Äôt copy tree |
| Block `{ }`           | Auto-end borrow immediately        |
