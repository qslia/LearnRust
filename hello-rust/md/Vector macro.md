Perfect question 👍 — this line is very **important and elegant** in Rust.
Let’s break it down fully:

---

### 💡 Line

```rust
let mut row = vec![1; i + 1];
```

---

### 🧩 1️⃣ `vec![ ... ]` — Vector macro

`vec![]` is a **Rust macro** to create a `Vec` (growable list).
For example:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3]; // makes a Vec<i32> with elements [1, 2, 3]
```

---

### 🧩 2️⃣ `[1; i + 1]` — Repeat syntax

Inside the macro, `[value; count]` means:

> “Create a vector filled with `value`, repeated `count` times.”

So:

```rust
vec![1; 3]  // => [1, 1, 1]
vec![5; 4]  // => [5, 5, 5, 5]
```

That’s different from:

```rust
vec![1, 3]  // => [1, 3]
```

---

### 🧩 3️⃣ `let mut row = ...`

We make it **mutable** (`mut`) because we’ll change elements later:

```rust
for j in 1..i {
    row[j] = res[i - 1][j - 1] + res[i - 1][j];
}
```

Without `mut`, that would cause an error — immutable variables can’t be modified.

---

### ✅ So in plain English:

> “Create a mutable vector named `row` with length `i + 1`,
> and fill all positions with the number 1.”

---

### 🧠 Example

If `i = 0`:
`vec![1; 1] → [1]`
If `i = 1`:
`vec![1; 2] → [1, 1]`
If `i = 2`:
`vec![1; 3] → [1, 1, 1]`

Then the loop updates the **middle** numbers.

Would you like me to show how this line’s result (`row`) changes step by step for the first few rows of Pascal’s triangle?
