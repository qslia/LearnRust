Excellent â€” this is a key line to understand the **algorithm logic** in your longest common prefix function ðŸ’¡

Letâ€™s break it down slowly and clearly ðŸ‘‡

---

## ðŸ§© The line in context

```rust
while !s.starts_with(&prefix) {
    prefix.pop(); // remove last character
    if prefix.is_empty() {
        return "".to_string();
    }
}
```

---

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s happening conceptually

Youâ€™re trying to find the **longest common prefix** among multiple strings.

* `prefix` starts as the **first string** (e.g., `"flower"`)
* Then you compare it with the next string (e.g., `"flow"`)

If the current string `s` doesnâ€™t start with `prefix`,
you shorten `prefix` â€” one character at a time â€” until it matches.

---

### Example step-by-step:

Input:

```rust
["flower", "flow", "flight"]
```

Start:

```rust
prefix = "flower"
s = "flow"
```

Check:

```
"flow".starts_with("flower") â†’ false
```

So:

```rust
prefix.pop();  // remove 'r' â†’ "flowe"
"flow".starts_with("flowe") â†’ false
prefix.pop();  // remove 'e' â†’ "flow"
"flow".starts_with("flow") â†’ true âœ…
```

Now the prefix matches `"flow"`.
Then the loop continues with `"flight"`:

```
"flight".starts_with("flow") â†’ false
prefix.pop(); â†’ "flo"
"flight".starts_with("flo") â†’ false
prefix.pop(); â†’ "fl"
"flight".starts_with("fl") â†’ true âœ…
```

âœ… Final prefix: `"fl"`

---

## ðŸª„ So what `prefix.pop()` really does

`pop()` removes the **last character** from a `String`.
Every time itâ€™s called, the prefix gets shorter â€” it trims from the right.

---

### Example of `.pop()`

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
s.pop();
println!("{}", s); // "hell"
```

---

## ðŸ§  Why this works perfectly

Because:

* You always shrink the prefix until all strings share that prefix.
* Itâ€™s safe (Rust strings are UTF-8 aware â€” `pop()` removes one valid character).
* It ensures you never check unnecessary prefixes.

---

âœ… **Summary**

| Code           | Meaning                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `prefix.pop()` | Remove the last character of `prefix`              |
| Used in        | Shortening prefix until it matches all strings     |
| Purpose        | To find the *longest* prefix common to all strings |

Would you like me to show how you could do the *same logic* using **character-by-character comparison** (a slightly different but also common approach)?
