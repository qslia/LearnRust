Great question 👍

`Some` is part of Rust’s **`Option`** type — a very common and important concept in Rust.

---

### 🧩 What is `Option`?

In Rust, a value that *might be missing* is represented by the type:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

So an `Option` can be:

* `Some(value)` → means there **is** a value.
* `None` → means there **is no** value.

---

### 🧠 Example

```rust
let x: Option<i32> = Some(10);
let y: Option<i32> = None;
```

* `x` has a value (`10`)
* `y` has no value

---

### 💡 In your code

```rust
if Some(ch) != stack.pop() {
    return false;
}
```

* `stack.pop()` returns an `Option<char>` because the stack **might be empty**.

  * If the stack is empty → returns `None`
  * If the stack has elements → returns `Some(top_element)`

* `Some(ch)` wraps the current closing bracket in an `Option`, so we can compare them directly:

  * If they match → continue
  * If not, or if the stack was empty → return `false`

---

### 🔍 Example in context

Say the stack has `[')']`, and we encounter `ch = ')'`:

```rust
stack.pop()   // returns Some(')')
Some(ch)      // Some(')')
```

Comparison → `Some(')') == Some(')')` ✅ → OK

But if the stack were empty:

```rust
stack.pop()   // returns None
Some(')')     // Some(')')
```

Comparison → `Some(')') != None` ❌ → invalid

---

So in short:

> `Some(x)` means “there is a value `x`”, while `None` means “no value”.
> In your code, `Some(ch) != stack.pop()` checks whether the popped bracket matches the current one.

Would you like me to show how `Option` works step by step with `pop()` in a short Rust example?
