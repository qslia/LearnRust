Excellent — this is a very good detail to ask about 👏

Let’s look at this line from your Rust solution:

```rust
k as i32
```

It’s small, but it involves **type casting** — a core Rust concept.

---

## 🧩 1. The context

In your function:

```rust
pub fn remove_duplicates(nums: &mut Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    let mut k = 1;
    // ...
    k as i32
}
```

Here:

* `k` is created by `let mut k = 1;`
* So `k` has the type **`usize`**, because it’s used as an **array index** later.

In Rust, indexing and `.len()` both use the `usize` type.

Example:

```rust
nums.len(); // returns usize
nums[k];    // k must be usize
```

---

## 🧠 2. Why cast to `i32`

Your function is supposed to return an **`i32`**:

```rust
-> i32
```

But `k` is a `usize`.
Rust does **not** automatically convert between numeric types (to prevent hidden bugs).

So you must explicitly say:

```rust
k as i32
```

That means:

> “Convert the value of `k` from `usize` to `i32`.”

---

## ⚙️ 3. What `as` does

`as` performs a **type cast** — converting one type into another.

Examples:

```rust
let x: i32 = 10;
let y: f64 = x as f64;    // 10.0
let z: u8  = x as u8;     // 10
let n: i32 = 255 as i32;  // 255
```

If the value doesn’t fit in the target type, it **truncates** (wraps around).

Example:

```rust
let big: usize = 300;
let small: u8 = big as u8; // becomes 44 (because 300 mod 256 = 44)
```

That’s why Rust requires **explicit casts** — to make sure you’re aware of potential data loss.

## 💡 4. So in your code

| Variable     | Type                                      | Why                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `nums.len()` | `usize`                                   | Rust’s standard for lengths & indexes |
| `k`          | `usize`                                   | Used as index                         |
| Return type  | `i32`                                     | Problem statement requires it         |
| `k as i32`   | ✅ Explicitly converts to the correct type |                                       |

---

## ✅ TL;DR

| Expression | Meaning                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `k`        | A counter (type `usize`)                        |
| `as i32`   | Convert it to a 32-bit signed integer           |
| `k as i32` | Return it as the required type for the function |

So this line simply ensures **type compatibility** between what your code uses internally (`usize`) and what the function must output (`i32`).

---

Would you like me to show a short demo that prints the types and results of different Rust casts (like `usize → i32`, `i32 → f64`, etc.)? It’s a nice way to really see what happens.
