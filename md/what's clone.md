Excellent — that’s a really important Rust concept to understand 💡

---

## 🧩 In short:

`clone()` in Rust means

> “Make a **deep copy** of this value.”

So instead of just copying a *reference* (a pointer to the same data), it actually creates a **new, independent copy** of the data in memory.

---

## 🔹 Example 1: With simple types

For small, **Copy** types (like integers, booleans, and chars), you **don’t need `clone()`**, because they are automatically copied by value.

```rust
let a = 5;
let b = a; // simple copy, no clone() needed
println!("a = {}, b = {}", a, b);
```

✅ Works fine — both `a` and `b` are valid.

---

## 🔹 Example 2: With `String`

Now here’s where `clone()` matters.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1; // ❌ this moves s1 into s2
```

Rust gives an error if you try to use `s1` again after this, because **ownership moved** — Rust prevents double freeing of memory.

If you want both `s1` and `s2` to exist independently, you must clone:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone(); // ✅ deep copy
println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

Now `s1` and `s2` each own their own copy of `"hello"`.

---

## 🔹 In your code:

```rust
let mut prefix = strs[0].clone();
```

This means:

> "Make a deep copy of the first string in `strs` and store it in `prefix`."

That way, we can safely modify `prefix` (e.g., remove characters with `pop()`) without affecting the original string in `strs[0]`.

---

## 🧠 Why not just assign?

If you did:

```rust
let mut prefix = strs[0];
```

Rust would try to **move** the first string out of the vector (`Vec<String>`), which is **not allowed** when you still need to use the vector later.
`clone()` avoids that by **copying** instead of moving.

### ✅ Summary

| Term                 | What it does                          | Used for                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `=`                  | Moves ownership                       | Fast, but invalidates original |
| `.clone()`           | Deep-copies data                      | Safe, both usable              |
| `.copy` trait (auto) | For small types (`i32`, `char`, etc.) | Automatic                      |

Would you like me to show you a visual diagram of how **move vs clone** works in memory? (It helps a lot for understanding Rust ownership.)
