Great question 👍

In **Rust**, the keyword `let` is used to **declare a variable** — it’s how you create and name a value in memory.

---

### 🧩 Basic example:

```rust
let x = 5;
println!("{}", x);
```

* `let` declares a **variable** named `x`
* `= 5` assigns the **value** `5` to it
* Rust **infers** that `x` is an integer (`i32` by default)

---

### 🛡️ Variables are immutable by default

By default, variables in Rust **cannot be changed** (immutable).
If you try to modify one, you’ll get a compile-time error.

```rust
let x = 5;
x = 6; // ❌ error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable
```

---

### 🔄 Make it mutable with `mut`

If you want a variable that you can change, use `mut`:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
x = 6; // ✅ works fine
println!("{}", x); // prints 6
```

---

### 🧠 You can also specify the type

```rust
let x: i32 = 10;
let name: &str = "Rust";
```

---

### 💡 `let` is also used for pattern matching

You can destructure values too:

```rust
let (a, b) = (1, 2);
println!("a = {}, b = {}", a, b); // a = 1, b = 2
```

---

In your Roman numeral code:

```rust
let mut total = 0;
let mut prev = 0;
```

This means:

* Create a **mutable** variable `total` starting at `0`
* Create another **mutable** variable `prev` starting at `0`
  So that the code can **update** them as it loops through the string.

Would you like me to explain how `let` differs from `const` and `static` in Rust (for constants and global values)?
