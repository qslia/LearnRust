Excellent question — and a *very* important one in Rust 🧠

Let’s unpack what `i32` really means 👇

---

## 🧩 1. `i32` is a **data type**

It’s short for **“signed 32-bit integer.”**

That means:

* It’s an **integer** (whole number, no decimals)
* It uses **32 bits (4 bytes)** of memory
* It can store both **positive and negative** numbers

---

## 📊 2. Value range

| Type      | Bits   | Range                              |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `i8`      | 8      | -128 → 127                         |
| `i16`     | 16     | -32,768 → 32,767                   |
| **`i32`** | **32** | **-2,147,483,648 → 2,147,483,647** |
| `i64`     | 64     | -9e18 → 9e18                       |
| `u32`     | 32     | 0 → 4,294,967,295 (**unsigned**)   |

So `i32` can handle most normal integer calculations easily.

---

## ⚙️ 3. Why `i32` (and not just “int”)?

Unlike languages like C++ or Python,
Rust **requires you to specify** the integer type when the compiler can’t infer it — it doesn’t have a default `int`.

This helps:

* Avoid confusion between 32-bit and 64-bit numbers
* Catch overflows or mismatched operations early

For example:

```rust
let x: i32 = 10;
let y: i64 = 20;
let z = x + y; // ❌ compile error: mismatched types
```

You’d have to cast explicitly:

```rust
let z = x as i64 + y; // ✅
```

---

## 🧠 4. Signed vs Unsigned

| Signed                            | Unsigned                          | Meaning                                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128` | `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128` | `i` = includes negatives, `u` = only positives |

Example:

```rust
let a: i32 = -5;  // OK
let b: u32 = -5;  // ❌ Error: unsigned cannot be negative
```

---

## 🧰 5. In your function

```rust
pub fn remove_duplicates(nums: &mut Vec<i32>) -> i32
```

means:

* `nums` is a vector of 32-bit signed integers.
* The function returns an `i32` (the count `k`).

So if your input is:

```rust
vec![0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
```

it’s actually a `Vec<i32>`.

---

## 🪄 Tip

You can check the size of integer types in Rust:

```rust
println!("{}", std::mem::size_of::<i32>()); // prints 4 bytes
```

---

So in short:

> 🔹 `i32` = a 32-bit signed integer
> 🔹 Range: –2,147,483,648 → 2,147,483,647
> 🔹 Common default for integer math and arrays

---

Would you like me to show how **integer types differ in memory layout** (like how many bits each one uses, with an example)?
