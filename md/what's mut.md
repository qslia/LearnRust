Good catch — `&mut` is an important Rust concept! 🦀

Let’s break down this line:

```rust
let mut tail = &mut dummy;
```

---

### 🧠 Step 1: `&` means “borrow”

In Rust, `&x` is a **reference** — it lets you look at `x` without taking ownership of it.

But there are *two* kinds of references:

* `&x` → immutable reference (read-only)
* `&mut x` → **mutable reference** (you can modify through it)

---

### 🧩 Step 2: What `&mut dummy` does

Here:

```rust
let mut tail = &mut dummy;
```

You are saying:

> “Let `tail` be a **mutable reference** to `dummy`.”

So:

* You’re *not copying* `dummy`
* You’re just creating a *pointer-like reference* to it
* You can modify `dummy` through `tail`

---

### ⚙️ Step 3: Why we need it here

Earlier, we had:

```rust
let mut dummy = Box::new(ListNode::new(0));
let mut tail = &mut dummy;
```

* `dummy` is the **actual first node** (a real `Box<ListNode>`).
* `tail` is a **mutable reference** to it, so you can *move it forward* along the list as you build.

Then we can do:

```rust
tail.next = list1; // modify through the mutable reference
tail = tail.next.as_mut().unwrap(); // move tail forward
```

That’s possible **only** because `tail` is `&mut` (mutable reference).

If it were `&dummy` (immutable), Rust would refuse to compile — since you’d be trying to change `tail.next`.

---

### 💬 Think of it like this

* `dummy`: actual object
* `&dummy`: a read-only pointer
* `&mut dummy`: a read–write pointer

So:

```rust
let mut tail = &mut dummy;
```

means:

> “Let `tail` point *to* `dummy`, and allow me to modify what it points to.”

Would you like me to show a **tiny code demo** that shows the difference between `&` and `&mut` in action?

Great — this is another key Rust concept 👏

Let’s look closely at this part:

```rust
ListNode::new(0)
```

---

### 🧩 1. What it means

This calls the **associated function** `new` from the `ListNode` struct.

So it’s like saying:

> “Use the `new` function defined inside `ListNode` to create a new node whose value is `0`.”

---

### 🧱 2. How `ListNode` is defined

In your code (from the problem), `ListNode` looks like this:

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Debug)]
pub struct ListNode {
    pub val: i32,
    pub next: Option<Box<ListNode>>,
}

impl ListNode {
    #[inline]
    fn new(val: i32) -> Self {
        ListNode {
            next: None,
            val,
        }
    }
}
```

That means `ListNode` is a struct with:

* `val` — the number stored in the node
* `next` — an optional pointer to the next node

And inside the `impl`, there’s a function:

```rust
fn new(val: i32) -> Self
```

which constructs and returns a new `ListNode`.

---

### 🧠 3. What happens when you call it

When you write:

```rust
ListNode::new(0)
```

You get:

```rust
ListNode {
    val: 0,
    next: None,
}
```

So this creates a **single node** whose value is `0` and whose `.next` pointer is empty.

---

### 🧰 4. Why we use it in this problem

In your merge solution:

```rust
let mut dummy = Box::new(ListNode::new(0));
```

We create a “dummy” node — a *fake* starting node that helps simplify merging logic.

* It’s not part of the final list.
* It gives us a safe starting point (`tail = &mut dummy`).
* We’ll later return `dummy.next`, skipping the fake node.

---

### ✅ Analogy

Think of `ListNode::new(0)` as:

> “Make me a new node with value 0 and nothing connected to it yet.”

It’s the same as writing in C-like languages:

```c
struct ListNode* node = new ListNode(0);
node->next = NULL;
```

---

Would you like me to show how to manually build a tiny list with `ListNode::new`, like `[1, 2, 3]` in Rust?
