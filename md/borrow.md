Great question ‚Äî this one is **key** to understanding how `Rc<RefCell<T>>` works.

Let‚Äôs unpack it carefully üëá

---

### üß± 1. `n` is a `Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>`

In your binary tree code, every node is stored like this:

```rust
Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>
```

So if you do:

```rust
if let Some(n) = node {
    let n = n.borrow();
}
```

then here:

* `n` (inside the `if let`) is **a `Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>`**
* `n.borrow()` comes from the `RefCell` part inside it

---

### üß© 2. `RefCell::borrow()` explained

`RefCell<T>` gives **interior mutability**, meaning:

* You can **borrow** data immutably or mutably **at runtime**.
* Rust checks borrowing rules **dynamically** instead of at compile time.

There are two key methods:

```rust
borrow(&self) -> Ref<T>         // immutable borrow
borrow_mut(&self) -> RefMut<T>  // mutable borrow
```

When you call `borrow()`, you get a **smart pointer** (`Ref<T>`) that behaves like `&T`:

```rust
let node_ref = n.borrow();
println!("{}", node_ref.val);   // same as accessing n.val
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Why we need `.borrow()` here

`Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>` has two layers:

* `Rc` lets multiple parts of the code own the node.
* `RefCell` allows controlled access to the data inside.

To actually access the `TreeNode` fields, you must:

1. Use `.borrow()` to **get a reference to the inner data**.
2. Use `.borrow_mut()` if you need to **modify** it.

Example:

```rust
let node = Rc::new(RefCell::new(TreeNode { val: 5, left: None, right: None }));

// Immutable access
println!("{}", node.borrow().val);

// Mutable access
node.borrow_mut().val = 10;
println!("{}", node.borrow().val); // prints 10
```

---

### üîç 4. Visual analogy

Think of:

```
Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>
```

like a **shared box** containing a **locked drawer**.

* `Rc` = many people can hold a key to the box (shared ownership)
* `RefCell` = you must borrow the drawer to read or write it

  * `borrow()` = open the drawer gently to look (read-only)
  * `borrow_mut()` = open it to change things (write access)

---

### ‚úÖ 5. In your code

```rust
if let Some(n) = node {
    let n = n.borrow();              // immutable borrow to look inside
    helper(n.left.clone(), res);     // visit left
    res.push(n.val);                 // record value
    helper(n.right.clone(), res);    // visit right
}
```

Here, `n.borrow()` temporarily gives access to the node‚Äôs fields (`val`, `left`, `right`), but after that block, the borrow automatically ends.

Would you like me to show the **difference between `.borrow()` and `.borrow_mut()` with a small tree example** (printing and modifying nodes)?

<br><br><br>
Excellent question üëç ‚Äî those two (`Rc` and `RefCell`) are **smart pointers** from Rust‚Äôs standard library that allow safe sharing and interior mutability of data ‚Äî both are very common when working with binary trees and linked structures like LeetCode‚Äôs `TreeNode`.

Let‚Äôs go step by step üëá

---

### üß© 1. `Rc<T>` ‚Äî **Reference Counted Pointer**

* **Full name:** `std::rc::Rc<T>`
* **Purpose:** Allows **multiple owners** of the same data (shared ownership).
* **Used when:** You need to share one value across different parts of your program (for example, multiple parents or pointers referencing the same node).

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

let a = Rc::new(5);    // create reference-counted pointer
let b = Rc::clone(&a); // now both a and b point to the same value
println!("count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a)); // prints 2
```

* When all `Rc` clones are dropped, the data is freed automatically.
* But: `Rc<T>` gives you **only shared (read-only)** access ‚Äî you can‚Äôt mutate the inner value directly.

---

### üîí 2. `RefCell<T>` ‚Äî **Interior Mutability**

* **Full name:** `std::cell::RefCell<T>`
* **Purpose:** Allows **mutable access** to data even when it‚Äôs behind an immutable reference.
* **Used when:** You want to mutate data but Rust‚Äôs borrowing rules don‚Äôt allow normal `&mut` borrows (e.g., inside `Rc`).

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

let x = RefCell::new(5);
*x.borrow_mut() = 10;  // temporarily borrow as mutable and modify
println!("{}", x.borrow()); // prints 10
```

* `RefCell` enforces Rust‚Äôs **borrow rules at runtime** instead of compile time:

  * You can have many `borrow()` (immutable)
  * Or only one `borrow_mut()` (mutable)
  * If you violate this, your program panics at runtime

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Combine `Rc` + `RefCell`

This combo gives you:

* **Shared ownership** (`Rc`)
* **Mutable access** (`RefCell`)

That‚Äôs exactly what you need for **binary trees** and **linked lists** ‚Äî because:

* Multiple nodes can share ownership of children (e.g., tree references).
* You need to mutate node values or pointers inside them.

Example:

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct TreeNode {
    val: i32,
    left: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>,
    right: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>,
}

let root = Rc::new(RefCell::new(TreeNode { val: 1, left: None, right: None }));
root.borrow_mut().val = 42; // modify safely
```

Would you like me to show a **simple diagram** showing how `Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>` links left and right children in memory?
