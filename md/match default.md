Excellent ‚Äî this is another key Rust syntax feature! ‚öôÔ∏è

Let‚Äôs unpack this line from your code:

```rust
_ => {}
```

---

### üß© It appears inside a `match` expression:

```rust
match ch {
    '(' => stack.push(')'),
    '{' => stack.push('}'),
    '[' => stack.push(']'),
    ')' | '}' | ']' => {
        if Some(ch) != stack.pop() {
            return false;
        }
    }
    _ => {} // üëà this part
}
```

---

### üß† What `_` means

The underscore `_` is a **wildcard pattern** ‚Äî it matches **anything** that hasn‚Äôt been matched yet.

So:

* `(`, `{`, `[`, `)`, `}`, and `]` are already handled above.
* `_` catches *any other possible character*.

In this problem, since the string only contains parentheses, `_` should never actually match anything.
But Rust requires `match` expressions to be **exhaustive**, meaning *every possible case* must be covered.

So `_ => {}` acts as a **‚Äúdefault‚Äù or ‚Äúelse‚Äù branch**, just like:

* `default:` in a `switch` in C/C++
* or `else` in an `if` chain

---

### üí° The `{}` part

The `{}` means **do nothing** ‚Äî an empty block.

So `_ => {}` literally means:

> ‚ÄúFor any character not already handled above, do nothing.‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ In summary

| Part | Meaning                               |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- |
| `_`  | Wildcard (matches any remaining case) |
| `=>` | ‚ÄúIf matched, then do this‚Äù            |
| `{}` | Empty block (do nothing)              |

So this line ensures your `match` covers all possible inputs, even if some are ignored.

Would you like me to show a small example of `match` with `_` in action (like a mini switch-case demo)?
