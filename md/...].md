Excellent question again ‚Äî and this one goes right to the heart of how Rust slices work üëè

Let‚Äôs unpack it carefully üëá

---

### üîπ Syntax breakdown

In this line:

```rust
&h[i..i + n.len()]
```

the `..` is a **range operator** that means:

> ‚Äúfrom index `i` up to, but **not including** `i + n.len()`‚Äù

So, **Rust slice ranges are *exclusive at the end***.

---

### üîπ Example

Suppose:

```rust
let h = b"abcdef";  // same as &['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
let i = 1;
let n_len = 3;

let slice = &h[i..i + n_len];
```

That means:

```
&h[1..4]   // includes index 1, 2, 3 ‚Äî stops before 4
```

Result:

```
slice = b"bcd"
```

So:

* **Start index `i` is included**
* **End index `i + n.len()` is excluded**

---

### üîπ In your code

```rust
if &h[i..i + n.len()] == n
```

This checks whether the substring of `h` starting at `i` and having **exactly the same length as `n`** matches `n`.

Because `i + n.len()` is *exclusive*, the slice length is exactly `n.len()`.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Syntax    | Includes start? | Includes end? | Example (`h="abcdef"`) | Result |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | ------ |
| `h[0..3]` | ‚úÖ yes           | ‚ùå no          | `"abc"`                |        |
| `h[1..4]` | ‚úÖ yes           | ‚ùå no          | `"bcd"`                |        |
| `h[2..]`  | ‚úÖ yes           | ‚úÖ to end      | `"cdef"`               |        |
| `h[..3]`  | ‚úÖ from 0        | ‚ùå no          | `"abc"`                |        |

---

So to answer your question directly:

> ‚ùå No ‚Äî the slice `&h[i..i + n.len()]` is **not inclusive** at the end. It includes the start index but excludes the end index.

Would you like me to visually show how this works with a diagram (string positions and slice ranges)?
